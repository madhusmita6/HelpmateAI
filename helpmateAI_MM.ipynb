    "Solution will broadly contain three layers:\n",

    "**The Embedding Layer**: The PDF document needs to be effectively processed, cleaned, and chunked for the embeddings. As PDF is  large blocks of text, before generating the embeddings, you need to generate the chunksHere, the choice of the chunking strategy will have a large impact on the final quality of the retrieved results. So, make sure that you try out various stratgies and compare their performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect in the embedding layer is the choice of the embedding model. You can choose to embed your chunks using the OpenAI embedding model or any model from the SentenceTransformers library on HuggingFace.\n",
    " \n",
    "**The Semantic Search Layer**: Here, you first need to design at least 3 queries against which you will test your system. You need to understand and skim through the document, and accordingly come up with some queries, the answers to which can be found in the policy document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you need to embed the queries and search your ChromaDB vector database against each of these queries. Implementing a cache mechanism is also mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you need to implement the re-ranking block, and for this you can choose from a range of cross-encoding models on HuggingFace.\n",
    " \n",
    "**The Generation Layer**: In the generation layer, the final prompt that you design is the major component. Make sure that the prompt is exhaustive in its instructions, and the relevant information is correctly passed to the prompt. You may also choose to provide some few-shot examples in an attempt to improve the LLM output.\n",
